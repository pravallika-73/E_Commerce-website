# E_Commerce-website
This project builds an e-commerce sales analytics dashboard using Python (Pandas, Flask), Chart.js, and Power BI.  Flask serves a web app with KPIs (Total Sales, Orders, AOV), interactive charts (sales over time, by category), date filters, and CSV report download, while Power BI creates a BI dashboard from the same data.
